/*
20047. Subsequence Problem

Problem code: SUBP

Given a string S which contains only digit-characters. How many subsequences(P) can be obtained from S such that every digit is strictly greater than all previous digits in that subsequence.

As for example if S=7598 then there are 8 subsequences which follow the above constraint. These are 7,5,9,8,79,78,59,58. Notice that 7598 is not a required subsequence because 7>5 and 9>8.

Note: A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

 

Input

Input starts with an integer T (â‰¤ 100), denoting the number of test cases.

Each case contains a string S. The length of S does not exceed 100. S does not contain any leading zeros.

Output

For each case, print the case number and P.
