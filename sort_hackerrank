step 1: make a hash table(key and value pairs of the order list given)
		e.g.
		list L is [c,h,a,b,e,j,f,i,d,g]

		hash table h:
		c->1
		h->2
		a->3
		b->4
		e->5
		j->6
		f->7
		i->8
		d->9
		g->10

step 2: traverse the array n times(if there are n elements in the input)
		at each traversal do this:-
		step 2.1: pick an element from the input and assign it as the minimum element
		step 2.2: now traverse the entire input to find the minimum element
			step 2.3.1 : how to find the minimum element:
						 if our assigned minimum element is ba and while traversing we encountered element bb, then since there first alphabet is same, we check their next alpabet "a" from ba and second b from "bb" , the value of a from the hash table comes out to be 3 and that of b comes out to be 4, so a is smaller and hence ba is smaller than bb.
						 find the minimum element like this in one pass.
			step 2.3.2 : repeat this step "n" times to sort the input.


example : 

input: ba, bb , cdie, a, j, c, d , h, ja, he, cf, dffc, acd, fi, fff

1. pick ba and min = ba
2. traverse the entire array to find the actual 1st minimum element.
3. bb encountered.
	ba < bb from our hash table
	min = ba
4. cdie encountered
	compare cdie and min(which is ba currently)
	compare their first alpahbet c and b, c value is 1 and b value is 4 and since 1<4 therefore c<b and hence cdie < ba
	therefore min = cdie

5. a encountered
	compare a and min(which is cdie currently)
	compare first element, c->1 and a->3, cdie is smaller
6. j encoutered
	comapare j and min(which is cdie currently)
	compare first element , c->1 AND j->6, cdie is smaller
7. c encountered
	comapare c and min(which is cdie currently)
	first alphabet is same , compare 2nd alpahbet, but "c" has no 2nd alphabet, therefore "c" is smaller than cdie, therefore min = c
8. similarly complete array is traversed, min = c

9. therefore the 1st minimum is c, output it(print it)  and remove c from the input array, so that it wont be compared again
10. traverse the array again, make min = ba again and traverse to find the 2nd min, it comes out to be 2nd min = cf

similarly the input is sorted.

answer: 
c , cf, cdie, h, he ,.......
